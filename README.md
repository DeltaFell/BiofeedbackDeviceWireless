The "Code" file contains the original device code produced by the 2020-2021 team.
The "Artemis Nano BLE Code" file contains new code and examples produced and found respectively by the 2021-2022 team.
The files labeled with "Nano" include new code designed to work with NRF24L01+ radio tramsitters.
"Nano" files labeled with "buttons" and "numbers" use boolean arrays rather than strings for radio transmission. As of 2/7/22, they are the most up to date code we have.
The files in the Circuit Diagrams folder are circuit diagrams and components for circuit diagrams. We used the Circuit Diagram extension for VS Code to run the XML files, which would render the associated PNGs. This will be updated with circuit diagrams regularly. Moving forward, we plan on using KiCAD to create circuit diagrams.

The Project's final code will be uploaded inside a Final Code folder.
